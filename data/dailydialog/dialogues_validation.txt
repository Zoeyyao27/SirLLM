So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . __eou__ What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! __eou__
Hi , my name is Tom . __eou__ Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . __eou__ Nice to meet you too.Melinda . __eou__ Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . __eou__ Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . __eou__ Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . __eou__ It looks like you guys work hard . __eou__ I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . __eou__ Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . __eou__ Sure thing . __eou__
What do you think of our price ? __eou__ Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__ Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__ I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . __eou__ I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__ I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__ Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__ We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes , this is the best we can do . __eou__ I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . __eou__
So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? __eou__ It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . __eou__ Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . __eou__ I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? __eou__ You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . __eou__ But what if I need my money suddenly ? __eou__ The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . __eou__ Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! __eou__ Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot __eou__ OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . __eou__
Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? __eou__ Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . __eou__ Which bus do I have to change ? __eou__ You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__
Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . __eou__ Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? __eou__ We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . __eou__ Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? __eou__ Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . __eou__
Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? __eou__ Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . __eou__ Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? __eou__ Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . __eou__ Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__ All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . __eou__ Okay , that's good . I get it . __eou__
Kate , you never believe what's happened . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Masha and Hero are getting divorced . __eou__ You are kidding . What happened ? __eou__ Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . __eou__ That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? __eou__ Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . __eou__ That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? __eou__ Early in the New Year I guess . __eou__

Hello . Excuse me . __eou__ Yes . Can I help you ? __eou__ Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . __eou__ Of course I remember you . __eou__ I think I lost my wallet here . __eou__ Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . __eou__ Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__ No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__ Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? __eou__ No . It's been empty the whole time . __eou__ Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . __eou__ I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? __eou__ No . My friend did . __eou__ Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__ Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . __eou__ I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? __eou__ Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__ Should I call the police ? __eou__ You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__ Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . __eou__ I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? __eou__ Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . __eou__ That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . __eou__ It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? __eou__ Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . __eou__ Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? __eou__ Is fifteen dollars OK ? __eou__
Have you got change for a thousand ? __eou__ Let me see . __eou__

If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? __eou__ Here is your receipt . Thank you . __eou__
Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly . __eou__ When did you last time have your eyes checked ? __eou__ Two years ago .

First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points . __eou__ All right . __eou__ Good.Now the other eye . __eou__ Well , this one is worse . __eou__ Never mind , just read as far as you can . __eou__ I can only read the first three lines . __eou__

Even the TV has the limit . __eou__ Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? __eou__ Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! __eou__ That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? __eou__ Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner ! __eou__ OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . __eou__ How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ? __eou__ Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . __eou__ Do you have a better plan ? __eou__ All right , all right . __eou__

Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . __eou__ It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . __eou__ You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . __eou__ The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . __eou__ Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . __eou__ To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . __eou__ Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . __eou__ It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . __eou__ You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . __eou__ While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately __eou__ Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . __eou__ Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . __eou__

What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__ I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__

Where are you going ? __eou__ I wanted to see the White House . __eou__ Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . __eou__ Oh , well thank you very much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__

I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__ Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__ Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__ Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__ Do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__ In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . __eou__ That is , your commission . __eou__ Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__ The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__ We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__ We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__ Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__ Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__ Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__ Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__ Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__ All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__ Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . __eou__
Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? __eou__ Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . __eou__ Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? __eou__
Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? __eou__ Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . __eou__ Are the prices on the list firm offers ? __eou__ Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__ I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . __eou__ All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? __eou__ How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . __eou__ I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . __eou__
Hello sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . __eou__ I see . Well , you have come to the right place .

I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . __eou__ We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications .

We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! __eou__ What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . __eou__ Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? __eou__ We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . __eou__ Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! __eou__ I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . __eou__ Yay ! __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? __eou__ Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . __eou__ From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . __eou__ I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? __eou__ Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , __eou__ So who has to stay behind ? __eou__ Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! __eou__
I want to rent this apartment . __eou__ I ’ m glad to hear that . __eou__ How much are you asking ? __eou__ You will have to pay $ 1050 every month . __eou__ I can ’ t afford that . __eou__ What can you afford ? __eou__ I was thinking $ 800 a month . __eou__ I ’ ll need you to pay more than that . __eou__ How much more ? __eou__ How does $ 900 every month sound to you ? __eou__ I can live with that . __eou__ We have a deal then . __eou__

So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? __eou__ I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . __eou__ The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__ It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? __eou__ 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__ Do I have to work on weekend ?

This is the best price we can quote . __eou__ Can we meet each other half way ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? __eou__ You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . __eou__
I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . __eou__ Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ? __eou__ My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 . __eou__ What kind of watch is it ? __eou__ It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . __eou__ Yes , we have it . __eou__ Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ? __eou__
What are your thoughts on the apartment ? __eou__ I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . __eou__ There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? __eou__ I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . __eou__ What problems ? __eou__ I did notice a few stains in the carpet . __eou__ We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . __eou__ You will ? __eou__ Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? __eou__ That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . __eou__ It is . I love it . __eou__
That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ? __eou__ Absolutely . Here it is . __eou__ Could I try it on ? __eou__ Please do , the fitting-room is over there . __eou__ It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? __eou__ I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? __eou__ OK . How much does it cost ? __eou__ It's 486 yuan . __eou__
Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? __eou__ As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__ Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__ So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . __eou__ The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? __eou__ To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__ That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__ Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? __eou__ Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? __eou__ Good . Friday morning at 9 . __eou__
Good morning . __eou__ Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ? __eou__ Thank you.But I will call her later __eou__ OK.Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . __eou__ I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . __eou__ Have you got the time , Tom ? __eou__ Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! __eou__ But you bought it only last month . __eou__ Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . __eou__ How long will it take us to get there ? __eou__ I think about ten minutes by bus . __eou__ It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . __eou__ Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ? __eou__ I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . __eou__ Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . __eou__ I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__ Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__ Ok . __eou__ Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . __eou__ I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . __eou__ Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . __eou__ Ok , thanks doctor . __eou__
Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? __eou__ I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . __eou__ I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? __eou__ Sure , please hold on . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . __eou__ You are so kind , you helped me a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . Bye ! __eou__
Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ? __eou__ Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . __eou__ Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? __eou__ I'm afraid so , yes . __eou__ Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? __eou__ Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . __eou__ What do you recommend we do ? __eou__ I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . __eou__ I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . __eou__
Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . __eou__ You should go to the dentist . __eou__ I hate dentists . __eou__ Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__ It always hurts . I hate going . __eou__ Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__ O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . __eou__ Good . You'll feel better after you do . __eou__
Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . __eou__ Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . __eou__ How long does it take to get there ? __eou__ About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . __eou__ Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! __eou__ Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . __eou__ Great ! I ’ ll take it . __eou__ Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! __eou__ I understand . Thank you very much ! __eou__ Have a great trip . __eou__
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . __eou__ A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? __eou__ The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . __eou__ So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? __eou__ It sounds like it will be . __eou__ I really hope it doesn't get cold . __eou__ That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . __eou__ The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . __eou__ That is true . The weather is constantly changing . __eou__ It would be nice if the weather would never change . __eou__ That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . __eou__ True . Predictable weather would make life easier . __eou__
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ I doubt that . __eou__
Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? __eou__ Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . __eou__ You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . __eou__ What's special about these things ? __eou__ Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . __eou__ Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . __eou__
I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . __eou__ You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . __eou__ Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . __eou__ Have you decided ? __eou__ Yes . I want to get a better job . __eou__ Could you tell me why you want to quit ? __eou__ I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . __eou__ OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . __eou__ Thank you so much for your advice . __eou__ And every best wish for your new job . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? __eou__ Let me see . Oh , No . 11 . __eou__ Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . __eou__ Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat . __eou__ Let's put our suitcases on the rack . __eou__ Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . __eou__ All right . __eou__
So , how should we get to the theatre ? __eou__ Let's take the bus . __eou__ I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__ It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__ It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__ We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__ Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . __eou__ If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? __eou__ We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . __eou__ Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . __eou__ It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . __eou__ Thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__ See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__
Let's go over this plan again . __eou__ From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . __eou__ And that is mostly flat , right ? __eou__ Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . __eou__ And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? __eou__ That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . __eou__ It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . __eou__ Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? __eou__
Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . __eou__ I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . __eou__ Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . __eou__ No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . __eou__ All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . __eou__ Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . __eou__
It's time for bed . __eou__ I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . __eou__ It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . __eou__ I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . __eou__ Why don't you try counting sheep ? __eou__ I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . __eou__ That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . __eou__ Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? __eou__ If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . __eou__ I promise I'll go to sleep soon . __eou__ No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . __eou__ See you in the morning . __eou__
I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . __eou__ How about your psychological resilience ? __eou__ I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . __eou__ How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? __eou__ I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . __eou__ You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . __eou__ Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . __eou__ Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . __eou__ I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . __eou__
Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? __eou__ I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . __eou__ Fine . At 3:30 ? __eou__
I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . __eou__ Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . __eou__ Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . __eou__ Nice meeting you , too . __eou__
I made my little brother cry . __eou__ Shame on you ! __eou__
I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? __eou__ Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . __eou__ Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? __eou__ We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? __eou__ Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . __eou__ I can help you with that . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ? __eou__ Yes , we are on the same plane . __eou__ But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami . __eou__ So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area . __eou__ Yes.It ' s quite troublesome . __eou__ Why not go and find a porter ? __eou__
Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . __eou__ But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! __eou__ You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . __eou__ It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? __eou__ I bashed it against the chair in my room . __eou__ Does it hurt ? __eou__ A little , but not much . __eou__ Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . __eou__ If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? __eou__ If you are better , but I doubt you will be . __eou__
This is your schedule . __eou__ You're going out of your way for us , I believe . __eou__ You are our honored guests . __eou__
Are there any vacancies still available ? __eou__ Yes . We need a plumber here . __eou__ I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . __eou__ I am sorry . They are not available now . __eou__
My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . __eou__ Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . __eou__ Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ? __eou__ Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? __eou__ There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table . __eou__ The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? __eou__ You know , that is one of my favorites ! __eou__ OK , I'll take one order of that . __eou__ You could choose another appetizer for half price to share . __eou__ Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . __eou__
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? __eou__ Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . __eou__
I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . __eou__ What would you like to speak to me about ? __eou__ I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . __eou__ I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . __eou__ Are you planning on voting ? __eou__ I ’ m going to vote . __eou__ Go to your polling place early on Election Day . __eou__ I will .

Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? __eou__ Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . __eou__ Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? __eou__ At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . __eou__ Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . __eou__ Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . __eou__ I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . __eou__ OK , let's go . __eou__
Where on earth are we ? __eou__ Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . __eou__ What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . __eou__ Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . __eou__ It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . __eou__
Hello . Front desk . __eou__ Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 . __eou__ Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Is it possible to change to another room ? __eou__ Could you please tell me why ? __eou__ My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . __eou__ So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__ Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . Can I move now ? __eou__ Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you . __eou__ Oh , thank you kindly . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . __eou__ Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . __eou__
Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . __eou__ Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__ No , nothing in particular . __eou__ You may ask questions about us , if you have any . __eou__ All right . When can I start ? __eou__
What are you doing here today ? __eou__ I would like to fight my ticket . __eou__ Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? __eou__ Yes , the officer is here today . __eou__ What's your case ? __eou__ I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . __eou__ Do you believe that the officer lied ? __eou__ There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . __eou__ Your license plate was caught on camera ? __eou__ A picture of my license plate was never taken . __eou__ Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . __eou__ Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . __eou__
Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? __eou__ Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . __eou__ Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . __eou__ That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . __eou__ What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . __eou__ So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . __eou__ Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . __eou__ After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . __eou__
what shall we do after the volleyball match ? __eou__ how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . __eou__ that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . __eou__ me , too . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . __eou__ I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " . __eou__ is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? __eou__ the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . __eou__ oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? __eou__ I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . __eou__ any other ideas ? __eou__ there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . __eou__ it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . __eou__
Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! __eou__ You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . __eou__ Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! __eou__ No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . __eou__ But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair ! __eou__ You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . __eou__ Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower . __eou__ I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ? __eou__ Thanks mom ! __eou__
It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? __eou__ Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . __eou__ That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . __eou__ The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . __eou__ Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__ Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . __eou__ Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . __eou__ Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . __eou__
Is the factory fully-automated ? __eou__ Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . __eou__ What about supply of parts to the production line ? __eou__ Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . __eou__ What about the smaller components ? __eou__ They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . __eou__
I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . __eou__ Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . __eou__ That's not why .

The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__ I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . __eou__ So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean .

I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . __eou__ We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__ Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__ I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . __eou__ But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__ I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__ There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__ Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . __eou__

I just need you to sign here . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ? __eou__ No problem , I'll get on that right away .

Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . __eou__
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__ Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . __eou__ Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__ I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__ I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . __eou__
hey , you look great ! how's everything ? __eou__ yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . __eou__ really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . __eou__ it's important to do proper exercises . __eou__ you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . __eou__ the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . __eou__ sounds reasonable . __eou__ we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . __eou__ and fruits ! __eou__ surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . __eou__ I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? __eou__ yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . __eou__ I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . __eou__ you bet it ! __eou__
Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . __eou__ I stayed with my friends . __eou__ You should at least give me a call . __eou__ I'm sorry , Mum . __eou__
Did anyone call ? __eou__ Just Mr . White . __eou__ What did he want ? __eou__ He wouldn't say over the phone . __eou__
What kind of job do you intend to do ? __eou__ I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . __eou__ What are your plans if you were hired ? __eou__ I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . __eou__
You stepped on my foot ! __eou__ Sorry . I didn't mean to . __eou__
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? __eou__ while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! __eou__ it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__ I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__ I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__ all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__ perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__ I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__ that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__ you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . __eou__

To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? __eou__ A dressy party would be fun ! __eou__ That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? __eou__ We should probably have both . __eou__ Yes , that will work out fine .

How did your company's fundraiser go ? __eou__ The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__ So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__ Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__ Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . __eou__ In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . __eou__

Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? __eou__ My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl __eou__ Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . __eou__ Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? __eou__ No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy __eou__ If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? __eou__ That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like __eou__ Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? __eou__ I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! __eou__

OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__ Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . __eou__ So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? __eou__ Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . __eou__ Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__ No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__ You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . __eou__

Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Could you tell me which bags are yours ? __eou__ They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them . __eou__ Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ? __eou__ Sure , here it is . __eou__ Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period . __eou__ Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment . __eou__
Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? __eou__ The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street . __eou__ How long will it take me to get there ? __eou__ It's about a ten-minute walk . __eou__ That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ? __eou__ No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station . __eou__ OK ! Thank you very much ! __eou__
I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . __eou__ Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__ Take your time . __eou__ I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__ We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__ The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__ Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__ When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__ How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__ Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__ I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__ Very well , I will . __eou__
Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? __eou__ Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . __eou__ Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . __eou__ Right ? OK , got it . __eou__ Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? __eou__ Next left then right ? OK . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . __eou__ I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' __eou__ I'm trying to find a post office . __eou__ Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . __eou__ Should I take the bus ? __eou__ No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Anytime . __eou__
It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . __eou__ Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . __eou__ So you must be an extravert ? __eou__ Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . __eou__ What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? __eou__ A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . __eou__ Don't you consider it a hard work ? __eou__ Hard but interesting , I think . __eou__ Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? __eou__ Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . __eou__ Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? __eou__ Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . __eou__

Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? __eou__ Will I need stitches ? __eou__ Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done .

What's wrong with you ? __eou__ I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ? __eou__ You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late . __eou__ You only care about your work . __eou__ Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family . __eou__ Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ? __eou__ OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

How is the result of your lab test ? __eou__ When it comes to that , I have a lot to say . __eou__ Then say it . __eou__ When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death .

Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? __eou__ Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? __eou__ Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . __eou__ Is there any flexibility on that ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . __eou__ OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . __eou__ Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . __eou__

They are just simple things . __eou__ They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . __eou__ Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . __eou__ Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . __eou__ Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . __eou__ No , quite the contrary . __eou__ Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? __eou__ Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . __eou__ Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . __eou__

Do you believe in god ? __eou__ Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? __eou__ I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . __eou__ I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__ I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__ Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . __eou__
Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? __eou__ They're going skiing in Colorado . __eou__ What a coincidence !

What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__ It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__ Sure . __eou__

But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? __eou__ No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . __eou__ All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . __eou__ Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . __eou__ Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? __eou__ Yes , that's fine .

You're finally here ! What took so long ? __eou__ I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . __eou__ It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . __eou__ I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . __eou__ perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . __eou__ I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ It would be better for the environment , too . __eou__ I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__ Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__ The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . __eou__ Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__ That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__ So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__ Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . __eou__
That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . __eou__ I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . __eou__ That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . __eou__ Sure , for at least three thousand per month . __eou__ That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . __eou__ I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . __eou__
Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ? __eou__ They'll be ready by this afternoon . __eou__ Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning . __eou__ Is that right ?

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently .

Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__

Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ But don't you like this place ?

Hi , Bob , everything okay ? __eou__ More or less . There's just one thing bothering me . __eou__ Oh ? What's that ? __eou__ Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . __eou__ What gift ? __eou__ It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . __eou__ You refused the gift ? That's terrible . __eou__ I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__ Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . __eou__ That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . __eou__
I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . __eou__ We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . __eou__ Swim stations ?

Now , how much do I have to pay ? __eou__ The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . __eou__ Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? __eou__ The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . __eou__ Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . __eou__ Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . __eou__

Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__

Here is the document you asked for this morning . __eou__ Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__ This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? __eou__ The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more .

What kind of place shall we rent ? __eou__ It should be close to the university .

I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . __eou__ Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area . __eou__ I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . __eou__ Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . __eou__ Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . __eou__ How much do you think the rent will be ? __eou__ I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . __eou__

We need to find our waitress and get our bill . __eou__ The waitress is bringing the bill right now . __eou__ This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? __eou__ Yes , this waitress did a great job . __eou__ OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . __eou__ What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? __eou__ Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? __eou__ Yes , 20 % would be perfect . __eou__ Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! __eou__ I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . __eou__

What's our target audience for this campaign ? __eou__ This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__ Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__ Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__ Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__ Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . __eou__

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . __eou__ Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . __eou__ Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . __eou__ Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! __eou__ Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . __eou__ Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . __eou__ Thanks doc ! __eou__ Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . __eou__
Would you like some more coffee ? __eou__ No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . __eou__ Good luck finding the waitress ! __eou__ The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? __eou__ I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . __eou__ Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . __eou__ So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . __eou__ How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? __eou__ I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . __eou__ I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . __eou__ I think that we should leave 10 % . __eou__ $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . __eou__

A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . __eou__ Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? __eou__ Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . __eou__ Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . __eou__ But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! __eou__ Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . __eou__
Would you care for a drink ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm fine . __eou__

Tell me about it . __eou__ It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__ What do you suggest ? __eou__ The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__ You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__ Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ Well . __eou__ I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__ I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__

So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . __eou__ You could have called . __eou__ I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__ You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? __eou__ Guess where we ended up . __eou__ I don't know . Where ? __eou__ When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . __eou__ Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__ I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__ Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__ I know it is . I don't know how it happened . __eou__ Hmm , maybe I do . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Maybe I have an idea how it happened . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__ Oh , that's what you think , huh ? __eou__
Won't you have some of this ? __eou__ Yes , thanks . __eou__ It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . __eou__ It's very good .

Do you have experience in advertising ? __eou__ Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . __eou__ What were you mean duties there ? __eou__ I mostly did advertising planning . __eou__ What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? __eou__ I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . __eou__ What was the most important thing you have learned at work ? __eou__ The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . __eou__
Dad , may I have a room of my own ? __eou__ Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . __eou__ Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . __eou__ Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? __eou__ Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . __eou__

I can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__ Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__

Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? __eou__ Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice .

My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Oh , damn .

Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ? __eou__ Yes . Who is speaking ? __eou__ This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ? __eou__ Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine . __eou__ Mr .

You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? __eou__ 110 pounds . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? __eou__ No , you know I can't bear eating less . __eou__ Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? __eou__ I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . __eou__ How's it going on ? __eou__ You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . __eou__ I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . __eou__ I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Ahhs ! I'm beat ! __eou__ What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! __eou__ I just got back from fighting the crowds . __eou__ You mean at the mall ?

Our men will be over in 5 minutes . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__ Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__ You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__

Let me help you . __eou__ Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ? __eou__ $ 280 . __eou__ Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money . __eou__

Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__ I could , but where's the fun in that ? __eou__

May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? __eou__ Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__ Why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__ For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . __eou__ So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? __eou__ No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed . __eou__ I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ? __eou__ Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . __eou__ Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV . __eou__ The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! __eou__ Yeah , it has no value at all .

I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__ I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__ Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__ Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . __eou__

I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__ But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__ A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__ Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__ Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__ This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__ Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__

There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . __eou__ Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . __eou__ I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . __eou__ Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . __eou__ That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . __eou__ Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration . __eou__

I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? __eou__ Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . __eou__ Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . __eou__ What about cats ? They are more independent . __eou__ Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . __eou__ How about a lizard ?

And easy to carry . __eou__ I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry . __eou__ So , we'd like to see some embroidery . __eou__
Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? __eou__ I had some bread for breakfast . __eou__ Let's go out for brunch . __eou__ Brunch ? __eou__ It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . __eou__ Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . __eou__

You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine . __eou__ They are both spicy hot , I've heard . __eou__ That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some . __eou__ They might be too hot for me . __eou__ Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them . __eou__ What about any special Beijing dishes ? __eou__ There's the Beijing roast duck . __eou__ Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ? __eou__ You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant . __eou__ Is it near here ? __eou__ Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean . __eou__ Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ? __eou__ Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver . __eou__ That's very kind of you .

I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? __eou__ Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . __eou__ Did you go to a real estate agent ? __eou__ No , that will be too expensive . __eou__ That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? __eou__ My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . __eou__ Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it so much . __eou__
Good afternoon . __eou__ My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ What ’ s the time ?

A set for appetizers and another for the main course . __eou__ Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ? __eou__ Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap . __eou__ Let's look at our menus . __eou__ Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking . __eou__ Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees . __eou__

Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too . __eou__ Very interesting .

what happened ? Why didn't he win ? __eou__ didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . __eou__ how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__ if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__ what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__ he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__ I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__ they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__ that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__ I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__ regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__ I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__ let's hope so . __eou__

That place is too ritzy for lunch . __eou__ True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? __eou__ Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . __eou__ I guess it is a little pricy . __eou__ Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. __eou__ That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . __eou__ That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . __eou__ Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? __eou__ You got it .

Face it . __eou__ Good luck to us . __eou__

We always welcome new customers . __eou__
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . __eou__ We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . __eou__ I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__ We need to find a good realtor . __eou__ Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__ But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . __eou__ Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . __eou__ I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has __eou__ Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . __eou__
I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . __eou__ Sorry to hear that . __eou__ How about next week ? __eou__ Fine , we'll be expecting you then . __eou__

We spent two days in the mountains . __eou__ How did you spend the night there ? __eou__ We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . __eou__ I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . __eou__ Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ? __eou__ Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains . __eou__ I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__

So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... __eou__ We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... __eou__ That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . __eou__
