See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! __eou__ I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . __eou__ Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . __eou__ Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . __eou__ That would be great ! Is it expensive ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . __eou__

I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__ It really hurts . __eou__ Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain .

Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__ Yeah , that's very important . __eou__ So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__ I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__ It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__ But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . __eou__ I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__ You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__ I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__ You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__ It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__ It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__
I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? __eou__ That's OK . __eou__
Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ? __eou__ Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates . __eou__ Thanks .

Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ? __eou__ Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . __eou__ That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead ! __eou__

In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future . __eou__ Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ? __eou__ Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . __eou__ Have you got anything to ask me ? __eou__ Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ? __eou__ Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products . __eou__ I see . This is my advantage . __eou__ Good . Have you got any other questions ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you . __eou__ Thank you , bye-bye . __eou__

Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? __eou__ sure . What do you need ? __eou__ well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__ but surely they won't fire you !

Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . __eou__ Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__ Agreed . __eou__ For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__ I understand your position . __eou__

How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . __eou__ How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . __eou__ Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . __eou__ I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . __eou__ That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . __eou__ That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__ I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? __eou__ Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? __eou__ All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . __eou__ Very well . Thank you . __eou__
Don't I know you ? __eou__ I'm not sure.You look familiar . __eou__ You're Mr.Stevenson , right ? __eou__ Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember . __eou__

You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . __eou__ Then do I have the chance to get this job ? __eou__ I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . __eou__ I know .

It's far too high . __eou__ And what's the cause of that ? __eou__ Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . __eou__ But I can't just slow down . __eou__ You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones .

You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? __eou__ Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . __eou__ So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? __eou__ Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . __eou__ Do you do the same exercises every day ? __eou__ No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . __eou__ Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? __eou__ It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . __eou__ Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . __eou__

I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__ No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? __eou__ Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__ Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production __eou__ That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__ I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . __eou__ Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? __eou__ It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__ Ah , get back to you . __eou__ Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ? __eou__
Do you need a guide ? __eou__ Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ? __eou__ It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day . __eou__ That's reasonable . __eou__
Aren't you Jim Green ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember . __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__ I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__ I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! __eou__ When did you finish ? __eou__ This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee ! __eou__

If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! __eou__ Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? __eou__ Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . __eou__
I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes . __eou__ I'm ready when you are , sir . __eou__ Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York . __eou__ You are so right , sir .

This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__ Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__ Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__ Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . __eou__ I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__ Not in a million years ! __eou__

It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . __eou__ You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . __eou__ The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . __eou__ Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? __eou__ It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . __eou__ It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . __eou__
Billy , you are late again . __eou__ I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__ Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ Don't take any chances .

So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? __eou__ We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay .

May I ask for an apartment ? __eou__ No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . __eou__
Mum , can I finish my homework later ? __eou__ Sorry . You know the rules . __eou__ But I want to watch TV now . __eou__ That ’ s out of the question . __eou__ Please . __eou__ Not a chance . __eou__ Not even for an hour ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s impossible . __eou__

He ’ s climbing the tree . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . __eou__ Tim is . __eou__ What about the dog ? __eou__ The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . __eou__

Do you like cooking ? __eou__ I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? __eou__ I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . __eou__ You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . __eou__ So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . __eou__ Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . __eou__ Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? __eou__ Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . __eou__ How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ? __eou__ Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . __eou__

Smith , I's like to ask you a question . __eou__ OK , please . __eou__ What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ? __eou__ Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities .

I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? __eou__ It's simple . You can use call transfer . __eou__ Is it so simple ? __eou__ Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . __eou__ It's true . __eou__ Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . __eou__ That's all ? __eou__ In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . __eou__

Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__ Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language .

Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__ Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities .

Here you are . You left the medicine here . __eou__ Sorry . I was too worried . __eou__ I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . __eou__ Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? __eou__ Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . __eou__ I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . __eou__ It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . __eou__
What kind of place shall we rent ? __eou__ It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . __eou__ Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . __eou__ Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? __eou__ I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . __eou__ Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . __eou__ Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days .

May I have a look at that vase , please ? __eou__ Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . __eou__ Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . __eou__ Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? __eou__
Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? __eou__ The local newspaper has ads for housing . __eou__ Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? __eou__ Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . __eou__ What do landlords charge for rent ? __eou__ Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? __eou__ There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . __eou__ You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . __eou__ I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . __eou__ Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . __eou__
Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ? __eou__ With pleasure . __eou__ I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__ Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__ Why is the price so high ? __eou__ It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__ Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__ Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__ Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__ But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__ True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway .

Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . __eou__ I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . __eou__

I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__ How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__ I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__ Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__ I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__ How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__ I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__ Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__ I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . __eou__
Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? __eou__ Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! __eou__ I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . __eou__ Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . __eou__ It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . __eou__
I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . __eou__ You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . __eou__ He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus . __eou__
Want to send out for some Chinese ? __eou__ Some what ? __eou__ Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . __eou__ No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? __eou__ Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . __eou__ Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? __eou__ Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered . __eou__ What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag . __eou__
Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? __eou__ I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . __eou__ It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . __eou__ Is that true ? __eou__ Definitely ! __eou__ If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . __eou__
Hello sir , how may I help you ? __eou__ I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . __eou__ I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? __eou__ It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . __eou__ I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? __eou__ Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . __eou__ I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? __eou__ Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . __eou__ Get out of my store , you jerk ! __eou__
I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? __eou__ I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . __eou__ You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? __eou__ I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . __eou__ Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . __eou__ Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . __eou__ How many people are on the waiting list right now ? __eou__ Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 . __eou__
How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__
You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . __eou__ I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . __eou__ You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . __eou__
What sort of job would you like to take ? __eou__ I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . __eou__ We need an operator now . __eou__ It's just the job I've been searching for . __eou__
I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . __eou__ I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . __eou__ And it takes up all the news . __eou__ The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . __eou__ It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . __eou__ Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . __eou__ I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . __eou__ Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . __eou__
Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? __eou__ I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ? __eou__ Sure . No problem . __eou__ Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ? __eou__ Sure . Do you have my number ? __eou__ Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__ No problem . I'll wait for your call . __eou__
What are you typing there ? __eou__ I'm working on my resume . __eou__ Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . __eou__ Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? __eou__ I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . __eou__ Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . __eou__ Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . __eou__ But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . __eou__ How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? __eou__
Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? __eou__ Is this the one you want ? __eou__ No , the one next to it . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? __eou__ It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? __eou__ Yes , please . How much is it ? __eou__ It costs $ 200 . __eou__ It looks good . OK . I'll take it . __eou__
Happy birthday , Jim ! __eou__ Thank you , Lisa . __eou__ Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . __eou__ I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__ Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . __eou__
What's wrong with you ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold . __eou__ When did the trouble start ? __eou__ I was sick most of the night . __eou__ It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . __eou__ Have I got a high fever ? __eou__ Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - ' __eou__ Aaaaahh , aaaaahh . __eou__ Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests . __eou__ All right , thanks . __eou__ The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection . __eou__ What shall I do today ? __eou__ I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription . __eou__
I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning . __eou__ You can be sure of that , sir . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I called HP about my computer . __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They said I need a new hard drive . __eou__ That's too bad . How much is a new one ? __eou__ It's not too much , only about $ 85 . __eou__ Plus installation ? __eou__ No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , it's just a couple of screws . __eou__ That's nice . __eou__ It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . __eou__ If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you . __eou__
Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . __eou__ Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . __eou__ Yes , Mum . __eou__
Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . __eou__ I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__ I guess you are right . __eou__ Believe me . Everything will be ok . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
It's beautiful here . __eou__ Yes . I feel refreshed . __eou__ How long will we dock ? __eou__ In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm . __eou__ Yes . We come at the right time . __eou__
that was a really good meal , Gordon . __eou__ It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . __eou__ well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . __eou__ you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . __eou__ let's see how much the bill is . __eou__ don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . __eou__ what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . __eou__ no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . __eou__ no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . __eou__ alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . __eou__ that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . __eou__ just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? __eou__ you've got a deal . __eou__ great . Bye . __eou__ bye . __eou__
I hear you are planning to travel abroad . __eou__ Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? __eou__ In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . __eou__ Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . __eou__ Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . __eou__ And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . __eou__
This looks like a very nice house . __eou__ You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . __eou__ The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! __eou__ The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . __eou__ This home is gorgeous on the inside ! __eou__ Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . __eou__ The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . __eou__ Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . __eou__ I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . __eou__ The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next . __eou__ There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . __eou__ I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . __eou__
Room service.What can I do for you ? __eou__ l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room . __eou__ Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ? __eou__ Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well . __eou__
Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ? __eou__ Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ? __eou__ Sure . When do you want to take the plane ? __eou__ Next Monday . __eou__ Will that be first class or economy seat ? __eou__ What's the fare for a first class seat ? __eou__ $ 200 . __eou__ Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please . __eou__
Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? __eou__ Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . __eou__ That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . __eou__ And I can purchase that here ? __eou__ Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . __eou__
Are there any beds vacant ? __eou__ Yes , what kind of room do you want ? __eou__ I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . __eou__ Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . __eou__ Well , that's fine . __eou__
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . __eou__ You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? __eou__ Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t __eou__ Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? __eou__ Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . __eou__ Well , welcome to the team . __eou__
Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for . __eou__ Oh , thank you . __eou__ Is there anything I can do for you now ? __eou__ Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . __eou__ Certainly , sir . __eou__
Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? __eou__ Marry Lin please . __eou__ Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . __eou__ All right , could I leave a message ? __eou__ Certainly ! __eou__ Please ask her to call John . __eou__
Excuse me . Where is the way out ? __eou__ Well , that's what I'm looking for myself . __eou__ It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? __eou__ Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ? __eou__ It should be the way out . __eou__ OK . Let's go and see . __eou__
Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . __eou__ Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . __eou__ I think you should be more careful next time . __eou__ Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . __eou__
Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . __eou__ Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . __eou__ No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . __eou__ Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . __eou__
Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? __eou__ Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? __eou__ Things are going well for me , Joe . __eou__ Want to go see a movie tonight ? __eou__ My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . __eou__ Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? __eou__ What movie did you want to see ? __eou__ There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . __eou__ I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” __eou__ Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! __eou__
How's the bride-to-be ? __eou__ Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . __eou__ Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! __eou__ I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! __eou__ Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . __eou__ You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... __eou__ I will . Don't worry ! __eou__
Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? __eou__ Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . __eou__ Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . __eou__ I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . __eou__ Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . __eou__ Promise that you won't get angry . __eou__ OK , I promise . What is it ? __eou__ It's a kitty . __eou__ Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . __eou__ Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . __eou__ No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . __eou__ Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . __eou__ All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . __eou__ I will . Thank you , Mummy . __eou__
I was wondering if you could help me with something . __eou__ Sure , anything you say . __eou__ Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , just ask . __eou__ What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? __eou__ You need to know the type of shoes you want . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . __eou__ The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . __eou__ Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon . __eou__
Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ? __eou__ It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . __eou__ So , it has a history for more than a decade ? __eou__ Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis . __eou__
What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? __eou__ Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? __eou__ Well , everything really . __eou__ All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . __eou__
Let's do something outdoors today . __eou__ All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend . __eou__ Okay . what do you want to do ? __eou__ I want to go jogging . __eou__ All right . That sounds like fun . __eou__
Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . __eou__ I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . __eou__ But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . __eou__
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__ No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__ I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__ OK , will do . __eou__
I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . __eou__ What size do you want ? __eou__ I wear size 40 . __eou__ How about this one ? It's the latest design . __eou__ Oh , I like the color . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I'm looking for a pair of shoes . __eou__ What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . __eou__ I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ? __eou__ Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ They are $ 168 . __eou__ I'll take them . __eou__
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? __eou__ I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ Ok , then we can sign up for it together . __eou__
Who's it knocking at the door ? __eou__ I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? __eou__ All right . I'll get it . __eou__
Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? __eou__ No , we don't . __eou__ How many of you , please ? __eou__ Six , including two kids . __eou__ I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . __eou__
Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . __eou__ If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . __eou__ Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ? __eou__ I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . __eou__ Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? __eou__ Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . __eou__ How will I know what the numbers mean ? __eou__ You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . __eou__ How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? __eou__ We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . __eou__
This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . __eou__ If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__ What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__ I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? __eou__ What's your proposal ? __eou__ Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . __eou__ Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! __eou__ What would you suggest ? __eou__ The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . __eou__ That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . __eou__ OK . We can meet halfway again . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? __eou__ No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? __eou__ Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? __eou__ B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . __eou__ Oh , you mean Canal Street ? __eou__ That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . __eou__ Oh , I get it .

What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__ First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__ That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__ I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that .

did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? __eou__ why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__ do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__ no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__ I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__ I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__ why not ? It's their children , too . __eou__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__ that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . __eou__

I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . __eou__ All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks . __eou__

I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... __eou__ and what if it doesn't work out , right ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt .

I don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . __eou__ How long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ So , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . __eou__ Do you still play piano ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of my hobbies . __eou__

Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . __eou__ He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . __eou__ Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . __eou__ But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! __eou__ You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... __eou__ No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... __eou__ do you hear something ? __eou__

Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh , I can't . I have a date ! __eou__ Really ? Wow with who ? __eou__ This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . __eou__ Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? __eou__ Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . __eou__ That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? __eou__ It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . __eou__ I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! __eou__
Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . __eou__ Stay for dinner with us . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight .

I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! __eou__ So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? __eou__ Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . __eou__ Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . __eou__ I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__ Laura ... __eou__ Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . __eou__
Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . __eou__ What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . __eou__ I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . __eou__ Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . __eou__ You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? __eou__ But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . __eou__ Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . __eou__ Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . __eou__ I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . __eou__ Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . __eou__ That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . __eou__ How about a training course ? __eou__ A training course ? That must be costly . __eou__ But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ OK . __eou__

Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going to buy a CD . __eou__ Why not listen to music online ? __eou__ Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? __eou__ You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . __eou__ I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . __eou__ In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . __eou__ Can you recommend some to me ? __eou__ Certainly . Realplayer is a good . __eou__ Can I download it ? __eou__ Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . __eou__ I'll try it tonight . __eou__

He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__ So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? __eou__ I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . __eou__ Are you sure he really got the message ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . __eou__ That's hilarious ! What did he say ? __eou__ He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . __eou__ I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . __eou__

Which beach are you going to ? __eou__ it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . __eou__ what should I bring with me ? __eou__ we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . __eou__ I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . __eou__ do you like surfing ? __eou__ I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? __eou__ we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday .

I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . __eou__ Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? __eou__ Good idea . That might help . __eou__

Can you recommend some local attractions ? __eou__ How old are your children ? __eou__ I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . __eou__ I would recommend a day at the zoo .

what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? __eou__ my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__ well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t __eou__ that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__ you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! __eou__

My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . __eou__ I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . __eou__ Why were you in Japan ? __eou__ My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . __eou__ That's pretty cool . __eou__ I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . __eou__ Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . __eou__ Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . __eou__ Ok . __eou__

It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! __eou__
Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . __eou__ Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . __eou__ I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . __eou__ I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . __eou__ It must have really hurt afterwards . __eou__ Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . __eou__ I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . __eou__ I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! __eou__ Is there any pain now ? __eou__ No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . __eou__ Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . __eou__
How was the party ? __eou__ I had a fantastic time . __eou__
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out . __eou__ That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . __eou__ Ok , good luck to you . __eou__

Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm afraid so . __eou__ If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . __eou__ Yes , it is annoying . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? __eou__ Nothing particular . But , ... __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I , I don't know how to explain it to you . __eou__ Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . __eou__
How do you do ? __eou__ How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card . __eou__ It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens . __eou__ Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Thanks for your hospitality . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
Hey , what's new ? __eou__ Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? __eou__ Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . __eou__ What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? __eou__ Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . __eou__ That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . __eou__ But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . __eou__
Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? __eou__ That sounds great . Where are you going ? __eou__ I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper . __eou__ What should I bring ? __eou__ Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything . __eou__
What do you think of doctor Thomson ? __eou__ I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? __eou__ I can tell form the way he spoke to us . __eou__ Never believe his words . __eou__
Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . __eou__ I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . __eou__ Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . __eou__
What do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . __eou__
Are you free tomorrow night ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Shall we have dinner together ? __eou__ Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . __eou__ OK . I'll be happy to join you . __eou__
If only our company prescribe flex time . __eou__ The board has been considering introducing flex time . __eou__ Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . __eou__ Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . __eou__
Brian , do you know how to speak English ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Where did you learn ? __eou__ I learned in college . __eou__ You speak really well . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How long have you been in the U . S . ? __eou__ 3 weeks . __eou__ Is your wife with you ? __eou__ Yes , she just got here yesterday . __eou__ Have you been to California before ? __eou__ No . I've never been there . __eou__ Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? __eou__ Yes . I went there once on a business trip . __eou__
How are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . __eou__ Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ How are they at swimming ? __eou__ They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . __eou__
Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? __eou__ Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . __eou__ Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . __eou__ Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... __eou__ Is everything ready now ? __eou__ Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . __eou__ Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . __eou__ Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . __eou__ It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . __eou__ I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You're all the same . __eou__
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ? __eou__
How ’ s it going ? __eou__ I ’ m fine . Thank you . __eou__ Do you need anything ? __eou__ I need you to help me . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am looking for an article in a newspaper . __eou__ Did you check the periodicals ? __eou__ I didn ’ t even bother to think of that . __eou__ I ’ ll show you where to find your article . __eou__ I get lost in this library . __eou__ It ’ s right this way . __eou__ Thanks a lot for your help . __eou__
How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . __eou__ Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? __eou__ No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow night . __eou__

Good afternoon , Johnson . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? __eou__ Not bad , thanks . __eou__
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! __eou__ God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? __eou__ Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . __eou__ They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . __eou__ You'd better pay more attention to your health . __eou__ I will , thanks for your concern . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
It is too bad today . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . __eou__ How did you find him at last ? __eou__ It was the police wo helped me to do that . __eou__ It must have taught you a lesson this time . __eou__
I want to give our kitchen the works . __eou__ Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . __eou__ No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . __eou__ Why should we run after the fashion ? __eou__ I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . __eou__
Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? __eou__ I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . __eou__ Then tell me what's good about it . __eou__ It can't be expressed by words . __eou__
What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . __eou__ I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . __eou__
Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . __eou__ Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__ Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__
Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . __eou__ Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . __eou__ That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . __eou__
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__ Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__ That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! __eou__
I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? __eou__ Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . __eou__

Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . __eou__ But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . __eou__ That's not the gadgets .

You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? __eou__ When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ Figure skating .

Where were you born ? __eou__ Montreal . __eou__ When did you come to Los Angeles ? __eou__ We moved here when I was fourteen . __eou__ Did you go to school here ? __eou__ Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . __eou__ Did you get a job right after graduation ? __eou__ No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . __eou__ When was that ? __eou__ Let's see ... That was about six years ago . __eou__ I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? __eou__ I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? __eou__
Do you consider yourself a good mother ? __eou__ Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . __eou__ How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . __eou__ I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . __eou__ Does your husband feel the same ? __eou__ Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . __eou__
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . __eou__ let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . __eou__ I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . __eou__ you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . __eou__ I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . __eou__ we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? __eou__ that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . __eou__ the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . __eou__
What's his job ? __eou__ He used to be a policeman . __eou__ But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . __eou__ Yeah . He's a private eye now . __eou__

But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__ oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec __eou__ wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! __eou__ tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? __eou__ perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank . __eou__ no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__ we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . __eou__ great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . __eou__ no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . __eou__ Me , too .

What types of questions did you get ? __eou__ Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . __eou__ What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? __eou__ I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . __eou__ Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__ If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . __eou__ Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__ Thanks . See ya . __eou__
What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by " us " ? __eou__ Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married .

I can't get fully relaxed in it . __eou__ Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . __eou__ Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . __eou__ Did you always like pop music . __eou__ I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . __eou__ I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . __eou__ oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . __eou__ Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . __eou__

You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? __eou__ He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? __eou__ I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . __eou__ I can think of better things to dream about ... __eou__ Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . __eou__ That's crazy . __eou__

As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . __eou__ It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . __eou__ Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . __eou__ For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . __eou__ That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it .

He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . __eou__ Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . __eou__ I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . __eou__ There are so many things you have to prepare for . __eou__ I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . __eou__ It really must be an exciting time for you guys . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . __eou__ Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? __eou__ That's what I'm wondering , too . __eou__ I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . __eou__
Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? __eou__ Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . __eou__ We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? __eou__ Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . __eou__ What a pity ! You can't join us . __eou__ So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . __eou__
I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ? __eou__ Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight . __eou__ Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? __eou__ I prefer sea food . __eou__ ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . __eou__ That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . __eou__ See you later . __eou__ bye . __eou__
Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . __eou__ If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . __eou__ I did . But they said they won ’ t change them . __eou__ That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . __eou__
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ Totally agree . What is your solution ? __eou__ Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . __eou__ You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . __eou__
I am so busy today . __eou__ Can I help you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . __eou__ I ’ ll be glad to help . __eou__ Or maybe make the beds . __eou__ All you have to do is ask for help . __eou__ Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! __eou__ I ’ m ready and willing to help . __eou__
The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . __eou__ Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? __eou__ Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . __eou__ Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . __eou__ You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . __eou__
You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . __eou__ I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . __eou__ Do you feel ok ? __eou__ Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . __eou__ Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__ Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? __eou__ You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . __eou__ Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . __eou__ Zach , what's that on your arm ? __eou__ I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . __eou__ It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? __eou__ Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . __eou__ I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go . __eou__ Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! __eou__
I can't go to your party . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__
Do you like being a doctor ? __eou__ Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . __eou__ Can you tell me about it ? __eou__ You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . __eou__ What can you do when this happens ? __eou__ Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . __eou__
Have you eaten ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
It's too hot to read . __eou__ We'd better go out for a walk . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ Spring . __eou__ How about summer ? __eou__ I dislike it most . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the hottest season is summer in a year . __eou__ But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . __eou__
My son came home from three years in the navy . __eou__ It was a real red letter day for you . __eou__ Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . __eou__ You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? __eou__
I must be going . __eou__ Okay . Keep in touch . __eou__
Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . __eou__ I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? __eou__ Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . __eou__ But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . __eou__ I know why we have reservations . __eou__ I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . __eou__ But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . __eou__ Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? __eou__ Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . __eou__
Do you think Tom will be elected president ? __eou__ No , I think Harry will get it . __eou__ Let's make a bet on who gets it . __eou__ OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . __eou__
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . __eou__ Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__ You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . __eou__
What happened ? Why didn't he win ? __eou__ Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . __eou__ How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__ If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__ What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__ He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__ I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__ They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__ That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__ I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__ Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__ I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__ Let's hope so . __eou__
Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? __eou__ That's because Americans love sitcoms . __eou__ Sitcoms ? __eou__ Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . __eou__ In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . __eou__ I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . __eou__
Are you interested in history ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__ Some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . __eou__
You're looking great . __eou__ You , too . __eou__
What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . __eou__ You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . __eou__ Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . __eou__ It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . __eou__ Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? __eou__ Yes , they say I would get a big sum . __eou__ Have you discussed it with your wife ? __eou__ Yes , she leaves it to me . __eou__ As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . __eou__ I have to think about it . __eou__
Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? __eou__ Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . __eou__ Of course . __eou__
I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . __eou__ That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . __eou__ What do you think our chance are in other events . __eou__ In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . __eou__ We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . __eou__ I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . __eou__ You are very optimistic ! __eou__
Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . __eou__ I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . __eou__ Well , drop by if you can . __eou__ I will , do you want me to bring anything ? __eou__ No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . __eou__
It's said that John's broken up . __eou__ Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__ I hear that John's leading a double wife . __eou__ It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . __eou__
Let's play chess . __eou__ I haven't played chess for a long time . __eou__ That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . __eou__ Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . __eou__ You're a very good player __eou__ Not really , but once I won a prize . __eou__ So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . __eou__ My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . __eou__
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true . __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? __eou__ Harry Potter . __eou__ Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? __eou__ Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ Have you ever read this book before ? __eou__ No , but my little brother likes it very much . __eou__ It's really a good book . You will like it too . __eou__ I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . __eou__ Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? __eou__ Jane Austen . __eou__ Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . __eou__ I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . __eou__
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . __eou__ Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . __eou__ I guess we'll see just around . __eou__ Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . __eou__ You too . __eou__
Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! __eou__ I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! __eou__ But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! __eou__ Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! __eou__ What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? __eou__ Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__ So he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__ Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__ I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__ I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . __eou__ My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__
Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ? __eou__ Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? __eou__ Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great . __eou__ Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat . __eou__ Is it close by ? __eou__ It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ? __eou__ OK , I'd love the company . __eou__ This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . __eou__
have you ever been to Disneyworld ? __eou__ when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ that's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ when are you getting married ? __eou__ some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . __eou__ congratulations ! I had no idea . __eou__ thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? __eou__ do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! __eou__
Matthew ? Hi ! __eou__ Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? __eou__ It's got to be almost a year now . __eou__ How have you been ? __eou__ I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . __eou__ Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? __eou__ Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . __eou__ Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? __eou__ Mrs . Thou ? __eou__ Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! __eou__ I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? __eou__
Are you ready to go to the mall ? __eou__ Yeah . Dig my new pants ? __eou__ Copycat ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ You went out and bought khakis , too ! __eou__ No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . __eou__ Whatever . __eou__
Have heard of Paul ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He's got a promotion . __eou__ You're kidding . __eou__ No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . __eou__ I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years . __eou__ Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . __eou__ Well.Good for him . __eou__
Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? __eou__ I think the supermarket is closed now . __eou__ Oh , When does it close ? __eou__ It closes at 7:00 on Sundays . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 . __eou__ Alright . What do you want to do now ? __eou__ Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . __eou__ Where does she live ? __eou__ She lives in San Francisco . __eou__ How long has she lived there ? __eou__ I think she's lived there for about 10 years . __eou__ That's a long time . Where did she live before that ? __eou__ San Diego . __eou__
Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? __eou__ No . How about you ? __eou__ Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Search me . __eou__
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ What did you argue about ? __eou__ He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . __eou__ Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ Did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . __eou__ Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? __eou__ No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . __eou__ Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? __eou__
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . __eou__ No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . __eou__
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? __eou__ Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . __eou__ They must be amazing animals . __eou__ They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . __eou__ I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . __eou__ They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . __eou__
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . __eou__ I am not surprised , you eat too much . __eou__ And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . __eou__ No , I wouldn't think so . __eou__ I do wish I could lose weight . __eou__ Well , why don't you go on the diet ? __eou__ I've tried diets before but they've never worked . __eou__ Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should . __eou__
Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets __eou__ All right . __eou__ Here is your ticket . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , let's go in . __eou__ It is a new park , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , how do you know ? __eou__ I guessed it . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . __eou__ Oh , how wonderful ! __eou__
I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . __eou__ I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ Can you ride a horse ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? __eou__ I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ What a good idea ! __eou__
Where's Mrs . Johnson ? __eou__ Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . __eou__ I see . Can I sit down ? __eou__ Of course ! Make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Johnson . __eou__ Please , just call me Tom . __eou__ Okay , Tom . __eou__ Where's Cindy ? __eou__ She's upstairs in my room . __eou__ Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . __eou__
Have you heard of Paul ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He's got a promotion . __eou__ You're kidding . __eou__ No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . __eou__ Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . __eou__ Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . __eou__ Well . Good for him . __eou__
Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . __eou__ If we hurry , can we get there in time ? __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? __eou__ Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? __eou__ Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . __eou__ Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . __eou__ OK , let's go . __eou__ The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here . __eou__ Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . __eou__ Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . __eou__ Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . __eou__ Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . __eou__
Tim ’ s smiles are interesting . __eou__ Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . __eou__ You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . __eou__ How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! __eou__
Have you enjoyed your weekend ? __eou__ Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . __eou__ Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . __eou__
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . __eou__ It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . __eou__ Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I ’ m forming a music band . __eou__ Do you already know how to play an instrument ? __eou__ Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . __eou__ Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? __eou__ We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m a singer . __eou__ Perfect .

By the way where do you keep them or practice ? __eou__
What would you like for Christmas ? __eou__ I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . __eou__ Have you asked Santa ? __eou__ Yes and I've written him a letter . __eou__
Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! __eou__ George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . __eou__ Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . __eou__ Where will we sleep , then ? __eou__ In the van . __eou__ What about other expenses ? __eou__ Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? __eou__ The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . __eou__ As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . __eou__ Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! __eou__ You have such good ideas ! __eou__
What date will our field trip be on ? __eou__ The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? __eou__ Yes , I will make note of that . __eou__ Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 __eou__ I will be there half an hour early . __eou__ You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ? __eou__ Yes , someone is picking me up . __eou__ To get back to campus by 8 __eou__ Not at the moment — maybe later , though . __eou__ All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! __eou__
The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot . __eou__ I'm sorry for hero . __eou__ I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . __eou__ Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect . __eou__
How was your business trip ? __eou__ Great - they wined and dined us all week . __eou__
Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ? __eou__ My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ? __eou__ Two years or so . __eou__ That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ? __eou__ No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . __eou__ Do you enjoy work here ? __eou__ It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . __eou__ Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . __eou__ Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . __eou__ Glad to hear that . __eou__
Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . __eou__ What's the second solar system ? __eou__ It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . __eou__ Is this good news or bad news ? __eou__ It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! __eou__ You mean with people on it ? __eou__ Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I am telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you would be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You are all the same . __eou__
How was the movie last night ? __eou__ I didn't really like it . __eou__ Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__ I found it very disappointing . __eou__ She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__ I wasn't happy with it . __eou__ Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . __eou__
Good afternoon ! __eou__ Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? __eou__ I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? __eou__ Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? __eou__ Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What's the weather like in your country ? __eou__ Mm ... It's quite warm now . __eou__ Where do you live ? __eou__ In London.Where do you live ? __eou__ Here.Near this school . __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
I hear that Mary got mad . __eou__ So I heard . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with her ? __eou__ She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . __eou__
Um , what will you do this weekend ? __eou__ How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while . __eou__ A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ? __eou__ No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ? __eou__ Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too . __eou__
What ’ s on TV tonight ? __eou__ Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel . __eou__ Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal . __eou__ Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show . __eou__ No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny . __eou__ Yeah , if you ’ re a girl . __eou__ Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . __eou__ That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . __eou__ It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . __eou__ O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . __eou__ No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game . __eou__
It ’ s really terrible ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? __eou__ Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . __eou__ You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children . __eou__
Sarah , what did you do today ? __eou__ I went shopping . __eou__ Did you buy anything ? __eou__ Yes , I bought a few things . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ I bought this coat . Do you like it ? __eou__ Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? __eou__ At the mall on 5th street . __eou__ Was it expensive ? __eou__ No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . __eou__ That's cheap . __eou__ I know . It was a really good deal . __eou__ I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . __eou__
Hi , Victor . How are you ? __eou__ Oh , I'm fine . __eou__ So , are you going to go to class tonight ? __eou__ Maybe ... but I don't think so . __eou__ Really ? What's the matter ? __eou__ I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . __eou__ Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . __eou__ Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . __eou__
How's John doing ? __eou__ He can barely make ends meet . __eou__
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . __eou__ If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . __eou__ No way , if it still has 21 . __eou__
What's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . __eou__ Is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . __eou__
Come on , you are left behind ! __eou__ Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . __eou__ You just need more exercise . __eou__ Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! __eou__ I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . __eou__ But running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__ But I want to burn up more calories ! __eou__ In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__ Really ? I will slow down then . __eou__
Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? __eou__ I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__ Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . __eou__ Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . __eou__ It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__ But it's really exciting . __eou__ Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__ Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__ Yep . __eou__ I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__ Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . __eou__
It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__ The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__ Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__ It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . __eou__
Are you an art aficionado ? __eou__ Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__ I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__ Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__ I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . __eou__ I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__ That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__ Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . __eou__
What does your mother do , may I ask ? __eou__ My mother works in a company as an accountant . __eou__ Is she busy ? __eou__ Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . __eou__
Hello , Bessie . __eou__ Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! __eou__ My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . __eou__ I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . __eou__ Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Nice day , isn't it ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ It's a good day for a picnic . __eou__
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ Well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__ Turn on the TV for what ? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__ I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . __eou__
Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! __eou__ Brian ! How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! __eou__ Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . __eou__ Well , you look great ! How are you ? __eou__ I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__
How is your new dormitory ? __eou__ It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . __eou__ Well , do you all major in the same subject ? __eou__ No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__
Peter , how often do you exercise ? __eou__ Well , I swim and run every day . __eou__ Now , tell me , what do you eat ? __eou__ Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . __eou__ Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? __eou__ Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . __eou__ What do you drink ? __eou__ Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . __eou__
What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? __eou__ We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . __eou__ How hard is the climb ? __eou__ It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ What did you do last week ? __eou__ We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__ O . K . See you . __eou__
How many languages can you speak ? __eou__ I can speak French and German . __eou__ How well can you speak them ? __eou__ I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . __eou__ Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? __eou__ No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . __eou__
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? __eou__ Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__ It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__ You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__ Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! __eou__ It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . __eou__
Do you really have to work today ? __eou__ Yes . I'm afraid so . __eou__ But you'll miss out on the football game . __eou__ Oh . Well , it can't be helped . __eou__
How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! __eou__ Oh , do you really think so ? __eou__ Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . __eou__ But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . __eou__
I had an accident . __eou__ That's terrible ! __eou__
I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . __eou__ You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . __eou__
Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . __eou__ Come on ! You're pulling my leg . __eou__ Really ! Here's my trophy . __eou__ Wow ! Congratulations ! __eou__
What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Is that your wedding ring ? __eou__ I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . __eou__ Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? __eou__ In June . __eou__ Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? __eou__ Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . __eou__ You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ What kind of watch is it ? __eou__ It's a Tag Heer . __eou__ If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? __eou__ This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . __eou__ That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . __eou__ Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . __eou__
I'm really mad at Bob . __eou__ What for ? ( Why ? ) __eou__
Hi , Jack , how have you been ? __eou__ Not very well . __eou__ Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . __eou__ Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . __eou__ Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . __eou__ Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . __eou__ Maybe you're right . __eou__ Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! __eou__ Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... __eou__
Do you know Sally ? __eou__ Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . __eou__ Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you have the time ? __eou__ My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . __eou__ Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? __eou__ If we start now , we can make it by taxi . __eou__
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ China . __eou__ What is the score ? __eou__ China beat Brazil three to zero . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . __eou__ Ouch . __eou__ Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . __eou__
You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . __eou__ I'm sorry . I won't do it again . __eou__ Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . __eou__ Is this the sign ? What does it says ? __eou__ It says No smoking here . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? __eou__ Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? __eou__ First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . __eou__ That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__ How do you research your books ? __eou__ I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . __eou__ I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! __eou__ Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__ Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? __eou__ There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . __eou__ Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . __eou__
What shall I call him ? __eou__ Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . __eou__ What's he doing ? __eou__ He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . __eou__
For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . __eou__ That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! __eou__ I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . __eou__ That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . __eou__ Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . __eou__ Will it be an all day event ? __eou__ Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . __eou__ That was quick thinking . __eou__
I'm so glad I bought this watch ! __eou__ Cool ! Flashy red lines ! __eou__ I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . __eou__ Is it waterproof ? __eou__ Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . __eou__ Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? __eou__ Well , surfing , scuba diving ... __eou__
Do you take a bus to and from work ? __eou__ Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction . __eou__ Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded . __eou__ Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__ That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__ What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__ You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! __eou__ Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? __eou__ Yeah , absolutely ! __eou__ And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . __eou__ You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . __eou__
We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . __eou__ That's great . __eou__ Now let's get things ready . __eou__ Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . __eou__ That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . __eou__
Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . __eou__ Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . __eou__ And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . __eou__ Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . __eou__ There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . __eou__ That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . __eou__ Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . __eou__ My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . __eou__ OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . __eou__ Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . __eou__
It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul . __eou__ The boy is good for nothing . __eou__ As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . __eou__ He is hopeless . __eou__
Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? __eou__ Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? __eou__ Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . __eou__ Great , so what happens now ? __eou__ Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . __eou__
Do you believe in UFOs ? __eou__ Of course , they are out there . __eou__ But I never saw them . __eou__ Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . __eou__ You mean that you can them . __eou__ That's right . I can see them in my dreams . __eou__ They come to the earth ? __eou__ No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . __eou__ Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? __eou__ OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . __eou__ That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? __eou__ Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . __eou__ Wow . Sounds fantastic ! __eou__

I just thought the movie was ... boring . __eou__ Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . __eou__ Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary . __eou__ I like scary movies . __eou__ That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies ! __eou__ Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you . __eou__ Don't call me kid . I am a grownup . __eou__ Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? __eou__ Of course !

Say , what's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . __eou__ Do you play much tennis ? __eou__ Yes , quite a bit .

I was there in April . __eou__ Paris in the spring , eh ? __eou__ It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time . __eou__ Just like dear old London ! __eou__
They got a divorce at last . __eou__ It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . __eou__ You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . __eou__ That give us a good lesson . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . __eou__ What's wrong with her . __eou__ She is expecting . __eou__ Congratulations to you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . __eou__ I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please ! __eou__ How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . __eou__ You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway . __eou__
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . __eou__ Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ What is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies .

Is this a photo of your family ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . __eou__ You look so lovely . __eou__ How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . __eou__
I heard you've found a new job . __eou__ Yes , I'm now working in a company . __eou__ So you're quite happy with your new job ? __eou__ Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . __eou__
Would you come to spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve had a date already . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ May be some other time . __eou__
You received a letter in the mail . __eou__ Give it here . __eou__ Who ’ s the letter from ? __eou__ I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU . __eou__ I want to know what it says . __eou__ They didn ’ t accept me . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ It ’ s the truth . __eou__ Are you okay ? __eou__ I really wanted to get into NYU . __eou__ I am really sorry to hear that . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . __eou__
Why are you so quiet ? __eou__ My girlfriend just broke up with me . __eou__ You must feel terrible now . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . __eou__ You've been through this too ? __eou__ Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . __eou__ But it hurts too much . __eou__ I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . __eou__ What if I don't want to find another girl ? __eou__ You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . __eou__ You're right . __eou__ I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? __eou__ Yeah . Thanks for the talk . __eou__ I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . __eou__ Ok . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? __eou__ Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . __eou__ Would you take $ 12 ? __eou__ No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? __eou__ 13.50 ? __eou__ Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . __eou__
I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . __eou__ Never mind about that . __eou__ I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? __eou__ No , I won ’ t hear of it . __eou__
A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again . __eou__ Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? __eou__ A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ? __eou__ Not bad , But she's as busy as before . __eou__
Whatever we do , we should do it above board . __eou__ You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . __eou__ Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . __eou__
Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! __eou__ Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . __eou__ Can't Elvin handle it ? __eou__ I think he's got too much on his plate . __eou__
This is the best dinner I've ever had . __eou__ How about the soup ? __eou__ I've never tasted anything better . __eou__ How nice of you to say so . __eou__
Hey Nick , what are you up to ? __eou__ Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? __eou__ Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . __eou__ Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . __eou__ Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__ Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__ The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? __eou__ Let ’ s do it ! __eou__
Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . __eou__ I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . __eou__ Where were you ? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding . __eou__
Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? __eou__ Don't feel like it . I'm broke . __eou__ Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? __eou__ Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . __eou__ I'll go myself then . __eou__
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . __eou__ I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__ come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ really ? Is he married ? __eou__ no , of course not . He is still single . __eou__ then what's your problem ? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ office romance is very tricky . __eou__ it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__ cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . __eou__ Hey , Isabelle ... __eou__ Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__ Yes , I am the guy . __eou__ What a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__ Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__ How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) __eou__ Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__ Why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__ I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__
Peter , how often do you exercise ? __eou__ Well , I swim and run every day . __eou__ Now , tell me , what do you eat ? __eou__ Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . __eou__ Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? __eou__ Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . __eou__ What do you drink ? __eou__ Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . __eou__ What do you drink ? __eou__
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ China . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . __eou__ Wonderful ! __eou__
Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__ I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__ Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . __eou__ I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__ It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__ Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! __eou__
Isn't it wonderful walking here ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . __eou__ Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? __eou__ Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . __eou__ What's there after that ? __eou__ Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ What are they all for ? __eou__ Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . __eou__
Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? __eou__ I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . __eou__ What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? __eou__ Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . __eou__ And your parents took it badly ? __eou__ That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . __eou__ Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? __eou__ She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . __eou__ How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? __eou__ Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . __eou__ Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . __eou__ I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ Yeah , you can count on it . __eou__ I think so . Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him . He's good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__
What do you think of Frank ? __eou__ He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Whatever things get tough , he gives in . __eou__
Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . __eou__ I sure hope so . __eou__
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__
It's quiet everywhere in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like winter . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go ! __eou__ What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . __eou__ Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . __eou__ I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . __eou__ Yes . Very wonderful . __eou__ There is a snowman over there . __eou__ How lovely it is ! __eou__
Tim's always bothering me . __eou__ Just tell him off . __eou__
Who are those guys ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . __eou__ Oh . __eou__ Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! __eou__ All right ! __eou__ Here comes Jordan , though . __eou__ Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . __eou__ Which team do you think will win ? __eou__ The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . __eou__
I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . __eou__ It's ok . What do you want to ask ? __eou__ Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? __eou__ The first place you should go is the International Center . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . __eou__ What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? __eou__ They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . __eou__ Can we get any more help at the International Center ? __eou__ Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . __eou__ I see . It must be worth going to . __eou__ Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . __eou__ Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . __eou__ It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . __eou__
hi , Lander . What's wrong ? __eou__ I can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . __eou__ my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . __eou__ true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . __eou__ the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . __eou__ is that inflation ? __eou__ inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . __eou__ has the government taken some measures to curb it ? __eou__ yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . __eou__ but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . __eou__ you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . __eou__ how ? __eou__ for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . __eou__ sounds a good idea . __eou__
OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . __eou__ You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . __eou__ Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . __eou__ You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . __eou__ The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! __eou__ Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . __eou__
Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? __eou__ Yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ That makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ Yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__ Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__
What courses did you take in college ? __eou__ I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc . __eou__ Which course did you like best ? __eou__ I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive . __eou__
Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? __eou__ Certainly . What's the matter ? __eou__ I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . __eou__ Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . __eou__ Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? __eou__ That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . __eou__ Is the service charged ? __eou__ No . it's free . __eou__ Really . I'll get a computer at once . __eou__
We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? __eou__ It ’ s so cool ! __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid this seat is taken . __eou__ Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I prefer potatoes to eggplants . __eou__ I feel eggplants are more nutritious . __eou__ But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . __eou__ Oh , that's how you see it . __eou__
Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? __eou__ Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . __eou__ It's a deal . __eou__
Where do you plan to go this winter ? __eou__ Alps , suppose . __eou__ Oh , yes , you like skiing . __eou__ Right . __eou__
Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . __eou__ You were showing respect and admiration for them . __eou__ I wish I were a hero . __eou__
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
OK . Come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ Does the class start again , Mam ? __eou__ Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . __eou__ Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ Come on , baby .

Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes , I like collecting things . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? __eou__ Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on . __eou__ Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? __eou__ Yes , stones . __eou__ well , I can ’ t just imagine it . __eou__
Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? __eou__ Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . __eou__ Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . __eou__
What a nice day ! __eou__ yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__ great , let's go ! __eou__ hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . __eou__ exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__ yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! __eou__ why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . __eou__ are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? __eou__ never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? __eou__ yeah , I think so . __eou__ ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . __eou__ wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . __eou__
